- 👀 I’m interested in mapping of security controls, or as put it by NIST, Informative References between security controls. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about automation possibilities using OSCAL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mapping of security controls, OSCAL and similar.
- 📫 How to reach me is best through GitHub.
